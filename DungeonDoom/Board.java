public class Board {

/** this class serves as the main centralizer of the program
 * it represents the game board and have the logic for initializing and managing  the game.
 * It handles players, gold, walls  along wth user commands
 * currently the class is initialized with just one player that's why we declare a attribute called human and an attribute called bot
 * 
  * Attributes:
 * walls: this i s a list of wall objects representing obstacles on the board
 * golds :  list of Gold objects
 * botPlayers: a list of Botlayer objects
 * humanPlayers: a list of HumanPlayer objects,
 * emptyFloor :  an EmptyFloor object to determine the board dimensions
 * exits: a list of integer arrays representing exit coordinates on the board
 * dots: list of integer arrays representing empty tiles on the board
 * validLines : A list of strings representing valid rows of the board
 * scanner: a Scanner object for reading user inputs
 * human : a reference to the first  HumanPlayer object currently in the game
 * bot : a reference to the first BotPlayer object currently in the game   
 * 
 * 
 *  Main methods:
 * 
 * - getPositions(List<String> lines) : reads the board layout and creates game objects
 * - lookBoard5X5():displays a 5x5 view of the board centered on the human player
 * - updateBoard(Player player, char newChar): Updates the board with a new character at the player's position
 * - positionPlayers(): assigns random initial positions to the human and bot players
 * - initializeBoard(String filePath) : sets up the board from a file and prepares the game state
 * - processCommand(String command): handles user commands like `LOOK`, `MOVE <direction>`, and `PICKUP`
 * - processMove(String direction): moves the human player in the specified direction if valid
 * - processCollection(Player player) :allows a player to collect gold at their current position
 * - win(): Checks if the human player has met the winning conditions
 * - quit() : Exits the game, optionally checking the game state
 * - lose(): Ends the game if the bot catches the human player
 *
